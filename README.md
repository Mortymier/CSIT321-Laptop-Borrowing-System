This group project is a requirement for our 'Application Development and Emerging Technologies' course.

Our group has 4 members:
  - Bustamante, William
  - Cortes, Ken Daniel
  - Flores, EJ Boy
  - Saniel, Mitchel Gabrielle

Our task was to create a web application using React for the front-end and Spring Boot for the back-end.
For our database, we are supposed to use MySQL. What our group came up with was a laptop borrowing system 
since our school allows students to borrow laptops from the office of the College of Computer Studies 
(our department). The current borrowing system in place is only pen and paper, and we intend to improve the 
process of borrowing laptops, as well as tracking them within our university. However, that kind of goal is
reserved only for our 'Research and Capstone' course. For this course, we only need to achieve a working web 
application that can perform login, registration, and the core features of a laptop borrowing system without 
any considerations for SEO, security, and making a marketable/profitable app.

As of May 15, 2025, the project was already submitted to our professor. We were able to implement the core
features, but honestly, I wasn't satisfied with it. The application needs more polishing and there were too
many unnecessary and inefficient lines of code. There are also a lot of missing features, like a notification
for students whenever their borrow request gets approved/rejected and a search bar with filters so that
you can easily find laptops. Still, I was able to learn a lot from this project. Concepts like APIs, hooks, 
and more were fun to learn. It was actually my first time using React and Spring Boot, so I had to rely on a lot
of tutorials in order to help build this project. Moving on, I think I'm going to learn more about these two
frameworks since there is a high chance we will be using them in our capstone project.
